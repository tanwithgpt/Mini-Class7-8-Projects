## 🐍 Snake-Water-Gun Game – MP5 🎮  
**A fun CLI-based mini-game coded in Python.**

### 📌 About the Project  
This mini project lets the player play a classic *Snake-Water-Gun* game against the computer. It tracks each round, records the outcome, and allows replaying while maintaining a history log. This project was created purely using concepts like functions, conditionals, loops, random module, file I/O, and basic input validation.

### ⚠️ Notes  
- This game was coded as a **Mini Project** by a 7th-grade student in learning phase.  
- All logic and code were built independently.  
- This README was generated with the help of **ChatGPT** to document the project clearly.  
- The computer’s choice is shown after every round.  
- The game history is saved in `history.txt`.  
- Invalid player input is handled gracefully.  
- Rounds tied do not increase the counter, encouraging valid wins.
