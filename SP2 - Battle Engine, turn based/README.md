# 🛡️ Turn-Based Battle Engine (SP2 - Version 1)

A turn-based battle simulator built entirely without OOP — pure Python logic, dictionaries, and `random.choice()` power.

> “This ‘AI’ was just the `random` module. LUL.” — ChatGPT

## 🎮 Features

- ⚔️ Two fighters: You vs AI (CPU)
- 🎯 Actions: **Attack**, **Defend**, and **Heal**
- 💡 Easy & Hard difficulty modes:
  - **Easy**: Balanced stats
  - **Hard**: Smarter AI with healing and stronger attacks
- 🚫 Anti-spam: Can't use **Attack** more than 3 times in a row
- 🩹 Healing capped to avoid abuse
- 📉 Win/Loss detection with victory messages

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- `random` module
- Terminal I/O

---

## 📁 File

- `main.py` — The battle engine logic

---

## 🎓 Concepts Used

- Dictionaries for player/enemy stats
- Loops and conditionals
- Input validation
- Basic cooldown logic
- Randomized enemy behavior
- Functional programming (basic `display_hp()` helper)

---

## 🚧 Limitations (as intended)

- AI is 100% random (no strategy... yet)
- No file saving or advanced state handling
- No object-oriented programming (by design)

---

## 🚀 Planned for V2 (Coming Soon)

- Smarter AI with situational moves
- AI taunts and roast system 🔥
- Player can roast AI back
- Cooldowns for all moves
- Crit chance
- Battle log export (optional)

## 🪄 Magic Note

This README — its formatting, structure, and writing — was crafted by ChatGPT.

But the entire project — every line of code, every decision, every mechanic —  
**was fully created and written by me, Tanmay Raj.**

ChatGPT helped make this readme, but the ideas, logic, and execution are all mine.  
We built this like a team — me on the keyboard, GPT on the mic.
