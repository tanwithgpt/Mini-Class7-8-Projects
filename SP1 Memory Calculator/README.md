# 🧠 SP1: Memory Calculator with Indexed Recall

This is **SP1**, my first official **Sub-Project**, designed and built completely by me — a Class 7 student who codes not for school, but for the thrill of building stuff that works. 💻✨

## 💡 About the Project

This isn't just a basic calculator — it's a **Memory Calculator** that stores every result and lets users recall specific answers using their **index** in memory. It’s interactive, clean, and built from scratch with real logic — not tutorials.

Think of it as a math assistant with a memory.

## 🔧 Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations:  
  `Add`, `Subtract`, `Multiply`, `Divide`, `Modulus`, `Exponent`, `Floor Division`
- Stores all answers in a **memory list**
- Lets users choose how many operations they want to perform
- Prompts after each action, feels like a real assistant
- Recall any previous result using its index
- Error-safe and user-friendly
- Fully written in Python with no extra libraries

## 📌 Special Notes

- ⚠️ The **number entered by the host must be manually hidden** (in terminal)
- ℹ️ **Indexes start from 0** — first answer is stored at memory[0]
- 🧠 This project is fully built by me.  
  **This README was written with help from ChatGPT.** All code and logic is mine.

## 🎯 Goal

This project helped me practice:
- Loops
- Conditional logic
- Lists & indexing
- User input handling
- Clean UI-style logic without GUI

It’s one of many in my coding journey — and the beginning of much bigger things to come.
