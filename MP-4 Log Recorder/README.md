## ⚠️ Notes
- The logs are stored in `Logs.txt` in **append mode**, so make sure to **hide the file** or clean it if you’re starting fresh.
- The **number of logs shown** is currently not counted or analyzed. This version focuses only on **recording and displaying** logs.
- The log format is kept simple for easier reading and learning.
- 📝 *This README was written with the help of ChatGPT, but the entire logic and code were written by Tanmay Raj.*
