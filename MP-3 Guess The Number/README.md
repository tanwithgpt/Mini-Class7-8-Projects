# ðŸŽ® MP3 - Guess The Number (Host Mode)

This is a number guessing game where the **host sets the secret number and number of attempts**, and the **player tries to guess it** within the limit.

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

- Host inputs:
  - A secret number
  - The number of tries the player gets
- Player inputs guesses
- The game tells:
  - If the guess is too low or too high
  - If the guess is correct
  - If the tries run out

## ðŸ”§ Tech Used

- Python
- While loops
- `break` and `continue`
- Custom logic and conditions

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Uses `float()` to support decimal guesses
- The number entered by the host **must be hidden manually on the output screen** to avoid spoilers
- Designed and built fully in **Class 7**
- **All logic, design, and code by me**
- **README formatting and structure by ChatGPT**
