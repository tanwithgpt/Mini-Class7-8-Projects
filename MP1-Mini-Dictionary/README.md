# ðŸ“˜ Personal Dictionary in Python

Made by me while studying in Class 7 â€” this is a basic Python app that works like a mini dictionary.

## âœ… Features
- Search for a word's meaning
- Add your own words and meanings if not found
- Keeps learning as you use it!

## ðŸ›  Technologies
- Python
- Dictionary data structure
- Input/output
- Control flow (`if-else`, `loops`)

## ðŸ’¡ What's next?
I plan to:
- Add file saving
- Turn this into a GUI using `tkinter`
- Maybe even make a website version
